# CPP_Experiment_06: Looping Statements and Pattern Printing

## AIM:
To study and implement C++ looping statements using `for` and `while` loops 
to perform repetitive tasks such as:
- Printing fixed messages
- Generating star patterns
- Reversing a number
- Generating a password verification etc.

## OBJECTIVES:
- Understand the working of `for`, `while`, and `nested loops`.
- Apply loop control structures to solve pattern-based and logic-based problems.
- Practice using loops in real-life examples like printing patterns and verifying logic.
- Develop logical thinking and iteration control using counter variables.

## THEORY:

### What are Loops?
Loops are programming constructs that allow a block of code to be repeated 
multiple times based on a condition. They reduce code repetition and increase efficiency.
Loops are a core concept in control structures and are widely used in all programming languages.

### Why use Loops?
- To perform repeated actions automatically
- To simplify programs that would otherwise require manually writing the same statements
- To build logical structures like patterns, sequences, and verification processes

### Types of Loops in C++:
1. **For Loop**:
   - Used when the number of iterations is known in advance.
   - Consists of initialization, condition, and update in one line.
   - Ideal for counting, fixed-length iterations, and pattern printing.

2. **While Loop**:
   - Used when the number of repetitions is not predetermined.
   - Runs as long as the specified condition is true.
   - Ideal for user-input-based or condition-based logic like reversing a number.

3. **Do-While Loop** (Not implemented in this experiment):
   - Similar to `while`, but executes the loop body at least once before checking the condition.

### Nested Loops:
- A loop inside another loop is called a nested loop.
- Essential for 2D pattern printing like triangles, pyramids, or grids.
- Outer loop usually handles rows; inner loop handles columns or spaces/stars.

### Application Examples:
- Displaying messages multiple times
- Printing star triangles and pyramids
- Number manipulation like reversing digits
- Checking user input with limited attempts

## CONCEPTS USED:
- Looping Constructs: `for`, `while`, nested loops
- Counters and control variables
- Relational and arithmetic operators
- Input/output operations (`cin`, `cout`)
- Pattern logic using row-column approach

## OUTPUTS:

### 1. OUTPUT: Printing "SIT" 5 times using For Loop
SIT  
SIT  
SIT  
SIT  
SIT

### 2. OUTPUT: Printing Star Pattern (Pyramid)
    *  
   ***  
  *****  
 *******  
*********

### 3. OUTPUT: Reversing a Number using While Loop
Enter a number: 9073363  
Reversed number: 3633709
